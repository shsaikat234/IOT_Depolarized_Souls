# 🚖 AERAS Rickshaw Management System – Full Project Repository


---

## 📌 Project Overview

AERAS is an IoT-based Rickshaw Management and Ride-Hailing System designed to connect riders, pullers, and admins through a unified digital ecosystem.  
This repository contains **all components of the complete system**, including:

- ✓ **User-side microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino) code**  
- ✓ **Rickshaw-side Web App**  
- ✓ **Backend server (Node.js)**  
- ✓ **Admin dashboard code**  
- ✓ **README with setup instructions**  

The goal of AERAS is to provide real-time ride request handling, puller location tracking, trip monitoring, and centralized administrative control.
